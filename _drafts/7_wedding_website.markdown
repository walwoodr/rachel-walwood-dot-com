Straddling the line between tradition and technology is a challenge when getting married. For young couples, the expectation of their peers is to have a convenient digital experience, and the expectation of their elders is to have an entirely analog experience. When designing and building the Walwood Wedding website, I plumbed family, friends and peers to ensure that the experience was as seamless as possible for those who are comfortable in a digital environment, as well as those who arenâ€™t.

The website was built on Wordpress with a customized theme, including hand built maps (CartoCSS), and calendar integration. Design using custom watercolors, hand-drawn fonts, and open source texture libraries.
