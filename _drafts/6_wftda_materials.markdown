I worked with the Women’s Flat Track Roller Derby Association on a number of assets that they provided to member leagues.

## Roller Derby Basics ads

Performed needs analysis for content included in document, managed production of content and analysis of essential content and “nice to have” content. Ads were produced in eight size formats in color and black and white with essential content included in all ads, “nice to have” content included where possible.

## Promotional Leave Behind

Fully designed document around provided content.

Document was produced in eight languages.
