CoWork Cafe is an application to allow worker/nomads to seek out and keep track of the attributes of coffee shops that are most essential to determining whether or not they're a good place to work -- quality of the beverages, what kind of food is on offer, presence (or absence) of outlets, availability of gender neutral bathrooms, and whether the other customers are likely to be working as well. Find the information you're looking for and pay it forward by sharing the details of your favorite coffee shops.

Work Cafe is a React- and Redux-based web application built using a rails backend API.
React-based frontend repository can be found at https://github.com/walwoodr/work-cafe.
