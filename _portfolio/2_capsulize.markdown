Capsulize is an account-based web application by which you can manage your closet and wardrobe. You can add to your closet either by selecting clothing items from the platform's bank of clothing items, or by creating unique clothing items. With the items in your closet you can create outfits with any combination of clothing items.

Capsulize is built in Rails and is a re-build of a Sinatra-based application.
The Rails repository can be found at https://github.com/walwoodr/capsulize-rails.
